            <h2>Major Health Impacts of Poor Nutrition</h2>
            
            <h3>Cardiovascular Disease</h3>
            <p>Diets high in saturated fats, trans fats, and sodium significantly increase the risk of heart disease and stroke.</p>
            
            <div class="stat-box">
                <p>Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year. Poor diet is responsible for about 11 million of these deaths annually.</p>

            <h3>Type 2 Diabetes</h3>
            <p>Excessive consumption of refined carbohydrates and sugars can lead to insulin resistance and eventually type 2 diabetes.</p>
            
            <div class="stat-box">
                <p>According to the International Diabetes Federation, 537 million adults (20-79 years) were living with diabetes in 2021. This number is projected to rise to 643 million by 2030 and 783 million by 2045.</p>

            <h3>Obesity</h3>
            <p>Diets high in calories, particularly from processed foods, combined with sedentary lifestyles, have contributed to the global obesity epidemic.</p>
            
            <div class="stat-box">
                <p>In 2022, more than 39% of adults aged 18 and over were overweight, and 13% were obese. Since 1975, obesity has nearly tripled worldwide.</p>

            <h2>The Problem with Ultra-Processed Foods</h2>
            
            <p>Ultra-processed foods are industrial formulations made with ingredients not typically used in home cooking and designed to be hyper-palatable, convenient, and profitable.</p>
            
            <h3>Common Examples Include:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Packaged snacks and desserts</li>
                <li>Sugary breakfast cereals</li>
                <li>Reconstituted meat products (nuggets, hot dogs)</li>
                <li>Instant noodles and soups</li>
                <li>Ready-to-heat meals</li>
                <li>Carbonated and sugar-sweetened beverages</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="stat-box">
                <p>Ultra-processed foods now account for 57.9% of total energy intake in the United States, 51.2% in the UK, and between 25-50% in many middle-income countries.</p>

            <h3>Health Impacts of Ultra-Processed Foods:</h3>
            
            <div class="stat-box">
                <p>A 2023 meta-analysis found that for every 10% increase in ultra-processed food consumption, there was a 12% increase in risk for type 2 diabetes, a 15% increase in heart disease, and a 14% increase in all-cause mortality.</p>

            <h2>The Impact of Added Sugar</h2>
            
            <p>Added sugars are sugars and syrups that are added to foods during processing or preparation, not including naturally occurring sugars in fruits and milk.</p>
            
            <div class="stat-box">
                <p>The average American consumes approximately 77 grams (19 teaspoons) of added sugar daily—more than three times the recommended limit for men (36 grams) and almost five times the recommended limit for women (25 grams).</p>

            <h3>Health Consequences of High Sugar Consumption:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Weight gain and obesity:</strong> Sugar provides calories with no essential nutrients ("empty calories").</li>
                <li><strong>Type 2 diabetes:</strong> High sugar intake can lead to insulin resistance over time.</li>
                <li><strong>Heart disease:</strong> High sugar diets are associated with increased risk of heart disease.</li>
                <li><strong>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease:</strong> Excess fructose consumption contributes to fat accumulation in the liver.</li>
                <li><strong>Dental cavities:</strong> Sugar is the primary dietary factor in tooth decay.</li>
                <li><strong>Cognitive function:</strong> Some research suggests high sugar consumption may impair memory and learning.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="stat-box">
                <p>People who consume 25% or more of their daily calories from added sugar are more than twice as likely to die from heart disease compared to those who consume less than 10% of calories from added sugar.</p>

            <div class="tip-card">
                <h4>Focus on Whole Foods</h4>
                <p>Build your diet around minimally processed foods like vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, lean proteins, and healthy fats. These foods provide essential nutrients and fiber while typically containing fewer additives.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="tip-card">
                <h4>Read Food Labels</h4>
